# 🔒 Security Guide

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Venture Scout Bot and best practices for secure deployment.

## 🛡️ Security Measures Implemented

### 1. **Environment Variable Protection**
- All API keys are stored as environment variables
- `.env.local` files are excluded from version control
- No hardcoded credentials in the codebase

### 2. **Server-Side API Calls**
- **Perplexity API calls** are handled through serverless functions
- API keys are never exposed to the client-side
- Built-in rate limiting and error handling

### 3. **Secure File Handling**
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- Knowledge base files contain only public content
- No user data is permanently stored

## 🔧 Secure Setup Instructions

### Local Development

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Add your API keys to `.env.local`:**
   ```bash
   # Required for market validation features
   PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_actual_perplexity_key
   
   # Optional: For generating embeddings
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   COHERE_API_KEY=your_cohere_key
   ```

3. **Verify `.env.local` is gitignored:**
   ```bash
   git status # Should not show .env.local
   ```

### Production Deployment (Vercel)

1. **Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:**
   - Go to your project settings
   - Navigate to Environment Variables
   - Add `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` with your API key

2. **Deploy with secure API endpoint:**
   - The `/api/perplexity` endpoint handles all AI requests
   - No client-side API key exposure

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

### ✅ **Do:**
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Regularly rotate API keys
- Monitor API usage for unusual activity
- Keep dependencies updated

### ❌ **Don't:**
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Hardcode API keys in your code  
- Share API keys in chat/email
- Use production keys in development

## 🔍 Security Audit Results

✅ **No exposed API keys found**  
✅ **Environment variables properly configured**  
✅ **Sensitive files excluded from git**  
✅ **Server-side API protection implemented**

## 📞 Security Contact

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:
1. **Do not** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns privately
3. Include detailed reproduction steps
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes

## 🔄 Regular Security Maintenance

- [ ] Review API key usage monthly
- [ ] Update dependencies quarterly  
- [ ] Audit environment variables before deployment
- [ ] Monitor for new security best practices
